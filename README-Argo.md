# Case Report

## Approach
1. **ArgoCD Installation**: ArgoCD was installed on the Kubernetes cluster and the ArgoCD server was configured.
2. **Node.js Express Application Deployment**: The application was deployed to the Kubernetes cluster using a Helm chart. The `values.yaml` file was configured to use the Docker image hosted on ECR.
3. **Automated Deployment**: ArgoCD was configured to automatically synchronize when new Docker images are pushed. This was achieved using the `argocd/application.yaml` file.
4. **Slack Notifications**: Slack notifications were configured using the ArgoCD Notifications Controller to send alerts to a Slack channel upon specific events. This was set up using a ConfigMap and a Secret.
5. **Kubernetes Configurations**: Basic Kubernetes resources such as Deployment and Namespace were created and configured.

## Personal Note
**I did not have hands-on experience with this topic before starting this project.** I researched and learned the necessary steps to try to implement the solution effectively. This approach ensured continuous deployment and monitoring of the application. ArgoCD's automatic synchronization and notification features allowed for real-time tracking of application updates and status.
