# Terraform Infrastructure Deployment

## Approach to Solving Terraform Cases with Architecture Design

### Solution Overview
1. **Modular Design**: Utilized Terraform modules to encapsulate and reuse infrastructure components, such as VPC and subnets, ensuring consistency and ease of management.
2. **Variable Management**: Defined variables in `variables.tf` and used a `.tfvars` file to manage environment-specific configurations, promoting flexibility and scalability.
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Implemented a GitHub Actions workflow to automate Terraform commands (`init`, `validate`, `plan`, `apply`), ensuring continuous integration and deployment. AWS credentials and region were securely managed using GitHub Secrets.
4. **Environment Management**: Configured separate environments (development, staging, production) using different `.tfvars` files and GitHub Actions workflows, ensuring isolated and consistent deployments across environments.
5. **Secret Management**: Leveraged GitHub Secrets to securely manage sensitive information such as AWS credentials and region, enhancing security and compliance.
6. **Error Handling and Validation**: Included steps for formatting, validation, and security checks to maintain code quality and prevent misconfigurations.

This approach ensures a robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure deployment process, leveraging Terraform's capabilities and integrating seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines and AWS.
